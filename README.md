🧩 Plugin Matrix

| Plugin | Function |
|--------|----------|
| pluginaipayload_builder.py | Generates payloads from seeds  
| pluginaiseed_ranker.py | Ranks seeds by entropy and relevance  
| pluginaimodel_fuser.py | Fuses multiple models into one  
| pluginaicli_builder.py | Builds CLI tools from payload logic  
| pluginaiscraper_router.py | Routes scraper modules to targets  
| pluginaidashboard_injector.py | Injects branded dashboard with live status  

> Full plugin list available in /plugins/ — each phase compiler injects and executes 5 plugins.
